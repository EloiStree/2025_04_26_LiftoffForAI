 Is there an API to use Liftoff for training outside of the game as human or drone ?

To not use crappy drone simulator can we mod Liftoff or extract position of the game ?


What is my goal ?

Use API or hack drone games to not reacreate the wheel.
Them allows human code and AI to received those hacked information and send input to play them on my computers.
